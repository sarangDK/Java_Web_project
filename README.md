# Event Booking System 🎫

## Description 📜
A backend system designed to handle many events and room bookings from users, following best practices for **microservices using Spring Boot**.
Thanks to the integration of third-party services, a microservices architecture makes the system easy to extend and resilient to a high volume of requests.
